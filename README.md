# Mouse Trap Project
This repository contains all files required to recreate a standard conventional mouse trap. This mouse trap was created as a reverse engineering project during my time at Chaffey College. For this project, a standard mouse trap was disassembled to determine its components and construction. Then, using a digital calipher and a radius gauge, the parts were recreated via Solidworks into models and drawings that are dimensionally accurate.

The files are organized into three folders; one folder contains the 3D Solidworks file, the second contains drawings in standard Solidworks drawing format, while the last folder contains the drawings as PDFs for your convenience. These files can be accessed via their respective folders.

These files are availible to the public for educational purposes. If there are any comments, and/or questions regarding these files, please feel free to contact me via my website: https://longpd.weebly.com/
